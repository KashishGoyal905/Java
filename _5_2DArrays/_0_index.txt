1. how 2d array are stored:
        it is a storage of reference of multiple 1d array.

2. Jagged Arrays:
        means each row can have diff column size 
        we can acheive this by first creating 2d array and assigning only row size to it
        and creating new 1d array if different size on each row of 2d array.
        we can do this because 2d array is a storage of reference in the master array.
