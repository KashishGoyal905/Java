Selection sort -> in this sorting we find the smallest one and swap it with the first one.

Bubble Sort -> in this sorting we compare the adjacent and put the largest in the last one.

Insertion Sort -> in this sorting we make two parts one sorted one unsorted compare one else 
                   of unsorted ot sorted and put it in the right direction.(its like a card 
                    we take one by one and put it in the right direction).

Merge Sort -> in this sorting we compare first ele of each array and put the smallest one
                 in the ans array and keep on doing that until either of i and j become
                  greater and equal to their size then we bring two more loops to check
                   if any array is not empty then print.
